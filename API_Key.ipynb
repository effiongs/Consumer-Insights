            "**Explanation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **`sort_array(arr)`:**\n",
            "   - Takes an array as input.\n",
            "   - Determines the array size (`n`).\n",
            "   - Calls `insertion_sort` for small arrays (n <= 10) as it's often faster.\n",
            "   - Calls `quicksort` for larger arrays, which is generally the most efficient algorithm.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **`insertion_sort(arr)`:**\n",
            "   - Implements the insertion sort algorithm, suitable for small arrays.\n",
            "   - Iterates through the array, inserting each element into its sorted position within the preceding sub-array.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **`quicksort(arr, low, high)`:**\n",
            "   - Implements the quicksort algorithm, a recursive divide-and-conquer approach.\n",
            "   - Chooses a pivot element and partitions the array around it.\n",
            "   - Recursively sorts the sub-arrays to the left and right of the pivot.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **`partition(arr, low, high)`:**\n",
            "   - Partitions the array around a chosen pivot element.\n",
            "   - Places elements smaller than the pivot to the left and larger elements to the right.\n",
            "   - Returns the index of the pivot element.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Efficiency:**\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Insertion Sort:** O(n^2) in the worst case, but O(n) in the best and average cases (for nearly sorted arrays).\n",
            "- **Quicksort:** O(n log n) on average, but O(n^2) in the worst case. \n",
            "\n",
            "**Choosing the Best Algorithm:**\n",
            "\n",
            "- For very small arrays, insertion sort can be faster due to its simpler implementation.\n",
            "- For larger arrays, quicksort is generally the best choice due to its average time complexity of O(n log n). \n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Note:**\n",
            "\n",
            "This code provides a good starting point. Depending on the specific data and use case, you might explore other sorting algorithms like merge sort or heap sort. You might also want to implement optimizations like using a median-of-three strategy to choose the pivot in quicksort.\n",

            "* **Good Sound Quality:**  Generally considered good for the price, with impressive bass for their size.  The SoundID feature is appreciated by many, though some prefer a manual EQ.\n",
            "* **Decent ANC:**  While not top-tier, the ANC performs well enough for most users, particularly for blocking out everyday noises.  The wind reduction mode is a standout feature.\n",
            "* **Compact Case:** The charging case is praised for its small size and convenient design.\n",

            "**Cons:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Quality Control Issues:**  A recurring theme is defective earbuds, with many users reporting issues like one earbud losing sound, ANC malfunctioning, or the charging case failing. This inconsistency makes them a gamble. \n",
            "* **Limited App Functionality:** The app is often criticized for lacking a proper EQ, having limited customization options for touch controls, and occasional crashing.\n",
            "* **Battery Life:**  The battery life is considered average, particularly with ANC enabled, and not ideal for all-night use.\n",
            "* **Fit Issues:**  While generally praised for fitting small ears, some users find the fit uncomfortable or report issues with the eartips falling off.\n",
            "* **Limited Touch Control Customization:** The lack of single-tap functionality and limited customization options can be frustrating for some.\n",

            "* **Read reviews carefully:**  Look for recent reviews to assess the current state of quality control.\n",
            "* **Try different eartips:**  Experiment with different eartips to find the best fit for your ears.\n",
